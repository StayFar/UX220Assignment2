### About Me

My name is Farizah Naeem and I am a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University majoring in User Experience Design. As well as being a full-time student I am also an entrepreneur. I own a paper flower business called "The Flower Girl" which I started six years ago. I have a passion for the arts, travelling, reading, listening to new kinds of music, and learning new languages.
